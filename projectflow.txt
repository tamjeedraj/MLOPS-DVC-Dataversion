create git repo and clone it in local
create mycode.py and add code to it. (it will save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
Do a git add-commit-push before initializing dvc.
# pip install dvc
now we do "dvc init" (creates .dvcigonre, .dvc)
Now do "mkdir s3" (creates a new s3 directory)
Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote s3"
Next "dvc add data/"
Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
Now - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data.
Now make changes to mycode.py to append a new row in data, check changesvia "dvc status"
Again - - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
Then git add-commit-push (we're saving v2 of our data at this point)
check dvc/git status, everything should be upto date
Now repeat step 10-12 for v3 of data.
